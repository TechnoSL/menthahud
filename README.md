# **INSTALLATION GUIDE YOU ACTUALLY NEED TO READ THIS I KNOW YOU THINK YOU CAN INSTALL A HUD BUT THIS NEEDS SOME EXTRA STUFF**

You can install the main hud file like normal, i.e., drop the "MenthaHUD" and "speedo" folders into tf/custom. However, you NEED to add to your config the following two commands (preferably in autoexec or whatever idk if it resets or not when you restart game):

`tf_mm_dashboard_slide_panel_step 0`

`tf_dashboard_slide_time 0`

This controls the animation when you click on "Casual" to queue, and the menu slides out from the side. For some bizarre reason this animation is permanently baked in so these two commands are the only way I can find (right now) that control it. The menu still slides back out of view when you close, and preferably it just vanishes but whatever.

## Warnings and Precautions and Broken Things and Such
Firstly, I have made this hud using 16:9 1920x1080. In my videos using 4:3 windowed with no black bars or stretched, the main menu is a little bit weird. Still definitely usable as normal. I cannot guarantee it works nicely on ultrawide or other weirder resolutions, so just be warned if you do mess with your res.

Please note that because the above commands only controls how queueing for Casual looks, this means that as of right now **Competitive** and **MVM** queue screens are kind of messed up and I am too lazy right now to fix that given I have not queued for these gamemodes in forever. Arguably it would be a beneficial feature if the comp queue screen was so broken it was impossible to use.

Unless there is something drastically wrong with the hud idk if I will be maintaining it that much. This is more of a personal thing that a bunch of people got interested in more than a proper project Intended For People To Use Actually. Let me know in the comments for the YouTube video I posted for the hud because as of the time of writing I am dealing with some shit and so my discord/twitter/etc are not publicly accessible.
